  "problem": "Crew members need assistance in planning routes, and there is currently no feature to suggest sample routes for them.",
  "scope": "Develop a button in the crew interface that, when clicked, suggests a sample route based on predefined criteria or algorithms.",
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "A 'Suggest Route' button is visible and clickable in the crew interface.",
    "Clicking the button displays a sample route with key details (e.g., start point, end point, waypoints).",
    "The suggested route is based on logical criteria (e.g., shortest path, historical data, or predefined templates).",
    "The feature provides feedback if no route can be suggested (e.g., error message or empty state).",
    "The button is responsive and works across different devices and screen sizes."
  ],
  "tasks": [
    "Design the UI for the 'Suggest Route' button and route display modal/component.",
    "Implement the frontend logic to handle button click and display the suggested route.",
    "Develop a backend endpoint to generate or retrieve a sample route based on predefined criteria.",
    "Integrate frontend with backend to fetch and display the route data.",
    "Add error handling for cases where no route can be suggested.",
    "Ensure the feature is responsive and compatible with mobile and desktop views.",
    "Write unit tests for the route suggestion logic and UI interactions."
  ],
  "test_plan": [
    "Test the visibility and functionality of the 'Suggest Route' button in the crew interface.",
    "Verify that clicking the button triggers the route suggestion process and displays a route if available.",
    "Test the route suggestion logic with different scenarios (e.g., valid route available, no route available).",
    "Validate that the displayed route includes necessary details (start, end, waypoints).",
    "Check error handling by simulating backend failures or empty data responses.",
    "Perform responsiveness tests on various devices and screen sizes.",
    "Run unit tests to ensure backend logic and frontend interactions work as expected."
