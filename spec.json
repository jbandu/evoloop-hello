  "problem": "Crew members need assistance in planning routes, and there is currently no feature to suggest sample routes for them.",
  "scope": "Develop a button in the crew interface that, when clicked, suggests a sample route based on predefined criteria or algorithms.",
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "A 'Suggest Route' button is visible and accessible in the crew interface.",
    "Clicking the button displays a sample route suggestion to the user.",
    "The suggested route is based on logical criteria (e.g., shortest path, common routes, or predefined templates).",
    "The feature handles errors gracefully (e.g., no route available).",
    "The button is responsive and works across different devices and screen sizes."
  ],
  "tasks": [
    "Design the UI for the 'Suggest Route' button in the crew interface.",
    "Implement the frontend logic to handle button click events.",
    "Develop a backend endpoint to generate or retrieve a sample route.",
    "Define criteria or algorithm for suggesting a sample route (e.g., shortest path or predefined templates).",
    "Integrate frontend with backend to display the suggested route.",
    "Add error handling for cases where no route can be suggested.",
    "Ensure the button and route display are responsive for mobile and desktop views.",
    "Write unit tests for the route suggestion logic."
  ],
  "test_plan": [
    "Test the visibility and accessibility of the 'Suggest Route' button in the crew interface.",
    "Verify that clicking the button triggers the route suggestion process.",
    "Test the route suggestion logic with different scenarios (e.g., normal case, no route available).",
    "Validate that the suggested route adheres to the defined criteria or algorithm.",
    "Check error handling by simulating failure cases (e.g., API downtime).",
    "Perform responsiveness tests on various devices and screen sizes.",
    "Run unit tests for backend route suggestion logic and frontend interactions.",
    "Conduct user acceptance testing with a small group of crew members to gather feedback."
