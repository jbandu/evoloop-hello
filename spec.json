  "problem": "Crew members need assistance in planning routes, and there is currently no feature to suggest sample routes for them.",
  "scope": "Develop a button within the crew interface that, when clicked, suggests a sample route based on predefined criteria or algorithms.",
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "A 'Suggest Route' button is visible and accessible in the crew interface.",
    "Clicking the button displays a sample route suggestion to the user.",
    "The suggested route is based on logical criteria (e.g., shortest path, common routes, or predefined templates).",
    "The feature handles errors gracefully (e.g., no route available).",
    "The button is responsive and works across different devices and screen sizes."
  ],
  "tasks": [
    "Design the UI for the 'Suggest Route' button in the crew interface.",
    "Implement the frontend logic to handle button click events.",
    "Develop a backend endpoint to generate or retrieve a sample route.",
    "Define criteria or algorithm for suggesting a sample route (e.g., shortest path or predefined templates).",
    "Integrate the frontend with the backend endpoint to display the suggested route.",
    "Add error handling for cases where no route can be suggested.",
    "Ensure the button and route display are responsive for mobile and desktop views.",
    "Write unit tests for the button functionality and route suggestion logic."
  ],
  "test_plan": [
    "Test the visibility and accessibility of the 'Suggest Route' button in the crew interface across different devices.",
    "Verify that clicking the button triggers the route suggestion process and displays a route if available.",
    "Test the route suggestion logic with various scenarios (e.g., different locations, no available routes).",
    "Validate error handling by simulating backend failures or unavailable routes.",
    "Perform responsiveness tests to ensure the button and route display adapt to different screen sizes.",
    "Run unit tests to confirm the correctness of the button click event and route suggestion algorithm."
