  "problem": "Develop a simple web application that displays a 'Hello World' message with a counter that increments on a button click and includes a dark mode toggle feature.",
  "scope": "The application will be a single-page web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or a framework like React if specified). It will feature a counter starting at 0, incrementing with each button click, and a toggle for switching between light and dark themes.",
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "The web app displays 'Hello World' text prominently.",
    "A counter starts at 0 and increments by 1 each time a button is clicked.",
    "A toggle button switches the app between light and dark mode.",
    "Dark mode changes the background to a dark color and text to a light color, while light mode does the opposite.",
    "The app is responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices.",
    "The counter value persists after theme toggle."
  ],
  "tasks": [
    "Set up the project structure with necessary files (HTML, CSS, JS or React setup).",
    "Implement the 'Hello World' text display.",
    "Create a counter component with an initial value of 0 and a button to increment it.",
    "Develop a dark mode toggle button with logic to switch between themes.",
    "Style the app for light and dark modes using CSS variables or classes.",
    "Ensure responsiveness using CSS media queries or a framework's responsive utilities.",
    "Test the counter persistence during theme changes.",
    "Deploy the app to a local server for testing."
  ],
  "test_plan": [
    "Verify that 'Hello World' text is visible on page load.",
    "Test that the counter starts at 0 and increments correctly on button click.",
    "Confirm that the dark mode toggle switches themes and updates UI accordingly.",
    "Check that text and background colors change appropriately in both modes.",
    "Test responsiveness by resizing the browser window and checking on mobile view.",
    "Ensure the counter value remains unchanged after toggling themes.",
    "Validate that there are no console errors during interactions."
