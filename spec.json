  "problem": "Crew members need assistance in planning routes, and there is currently no feature to suggest sample routes for them.",
  "scope": "Develop a button in the crew interface that, when clicked, suggests a sample route based on predefined criteria or algorithms.",
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "A 'Suggest Route' button is visible and clickable in the crew interface.",
    "Clicking the button displays a sample route with key details (e.g., waypoints, distance, estimated time).",
    "The suggested route is based on logical criteria (e.g., shortest path, historical data, or predefined templates).",
    "The feature handles errors gracefully (e.g., displays a message if no route can be suggested).",
    "The button is responsive and works across different devices and screen sizes."
  ],
  "tasks": [
    "Design the UI for the 'Suggest Route' button and route display modal.",
    "Implement the frontend logic to handle button click and display the suggested route.",
    "Develop a backend API endpoint to generate or retrieve a sample route based on criteria.",
    "Integrate the frontend with the backend API for route suggestion.",
    "Define and implement the route suggestion algorithm or use predefined templates.",
    "Add error handling for cases where no route can be suggested.",
    "Ensure the feature is responsive and compatible with mobile and desktop views.",
    "Write unit tests for the route suggestion logic and API integration."
  ],
  "test_plan": [
    "Test the visibility and functionality of the 'Suggest Route' button in the crew interface.",
    "Verify that clicking the button triggers the route suggestion and displays the route details correctly.",
    "Test the route suggestion logic with various scenarios (e.g., different locations, no available data).",
    "Validate error handling by simulating API failures or cases with no route suggestions.",
    "Perform responsiveness tests on multiple devices and screen sizes.",
    "Run unit tests for backend logic and API endpoints to ensure reliability.",
    "Conduct user acceptance testing with a small group of crew members to gather feedback on usability."
