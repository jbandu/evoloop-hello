  "problem": "Users need a way to view a table of US states and their capitals within the application for quick reference.",
  "scope": "Implement a button that, when clicked, displays a table listing all US states and their corresponding capitals. The table should be clear, readable, and integrated into the existing UI.",
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "A button labeled 'Show US States & Capitals' is visible in the UI.",
    "Clicking the button displays a table with two columns: 'State' and 'Capital'.",
    "The table lists all 50 US states and their correct capitals.",
    "The table is styled consistently with the application's design (e.g., font, colors).",
    "The table is dismissible or toggleable (e.g., via a close button or toggling the same button).",
    "The feature is responsive and works across different screen sizes."
  ],
  "tasks": [
    "Design a UI layout for the button and table placement within the existing interface.",
    "Create a static dataset of US states and capitals (e.g., as a JSON object).",
    "Implement the button with an event listener to trigger the table display.",
    "Develop the table component to render the state-capital data dynamically.",
    "Add functionality to toggle or close the table.",
    "Style the button and table to match the application's theme.",
    "Ensure responsiveness for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.",
    "Write unit tests for the button and table rendering logic."
  ],
  "test_plan": [
    "Verify the button appears in the UI with the correct label.",
    "Test that clicking the button displays the table with all 50 states and capitals.",
    "Confirm the data in the table is accurate by cross-referencing with a reliable source.",
    "Check that the table can be closed or toggled off.",
    "Validate the UI styling matches the application's design system.",
    "Test responsiveness by viewing the feature on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).",
    "Run unit tests to ensure button click events and table rendering work as expected.",
    "Perform accessibility testing to ensure the button and table are navigable via keyboard and readable by screen readers."
