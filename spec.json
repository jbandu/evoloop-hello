    "A 'Suggest Route' button is visible in the crew interface.",
    "Clicking the 'Suggest Route' button displays a predefined sample route.",
    "The suggested route is visually distinct (e.g., highlighted or marked) on the map or route planning interface.",

    "Test 1: Verify that the 'Suggest Route' button is visible and clickable in the crew interface across different devices.",
    "Test 2: Confirm that clicking the button triggers the display of a sample route.",
    "Test 3: Validate that the suggested route is visually distinct on the map or interface.",
    "Test 4: Ensure the crew can accept or ignore the route without impacting other features.",
    "Test 5: Test responsiveness by checking the feature on various screen sizes and devices.",
    "Test 6: Run unit tests to verify backend logic for route suggestion.",
    "Test 7: Run integration tests to confirm the button and route display work seamlessly."
